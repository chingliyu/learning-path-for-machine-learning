## Checklist

Check your knowledge:

* Make a list of problems machine learning can and can not solve
* Come up with a chart/diagram with machine learning algorithms.  Start with this:
  - ML Algorithms
    - Regressions
      - Examples of regression algorithms
    - Another type
      - Example
    - and so on...
* Figure out what kind of machine learning we might use for the following scenarios
  - A bank wants to identify fraudulent credit card transactions
  - We want to estimate house prices for next month
  - We want group similar shopping behaviors of our customers
  - I want to identify damaged products from my assembly line
  - In self driving scenario, we want to estimate where the car in front of us is
