★★☆  - Medium  
★★★  - Challenging  
★★★★ - Bonus

### A - Creating Sets

#### A1 - Create a set `a = {10,20,30,40,50}` (★☆☆)
We will use this list for exercises below

#### A2 - Add 60 to set (★☆☆)

Print out the set and notice the order

### B - Searching

#### B1 - Searching a Set (★☆☆)

Create a Set with 10 random numbers between 1 to 100.

Now create another 10 random numbers, and check if these numbers are in the set.

#### B2 - De-duplicate  (★★☆)

De-duplicate this list of numbers.

`a = [1, 5, 2, 3, 1, 4, 3, 5]`

The output should be (in no order)

`1, 5, 2, 3, 4`

#### B3 - De-duplicate  (★★☆)

Print unique words from this paragraph.

```python
str = "it was the best of times \
it was the worst of times \
it was the age of wisdom \
it was the age of foolishness \
it was the epoch of belief \
it was the epoch of incredulity \
it was the season of light \
it was the season of darkness \
it was the spring of hope \
it was the winter of despair"

words = str.split()
# list of words. 
# Now find the unique words

```
