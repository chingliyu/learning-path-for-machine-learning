# Setting Up a Python Machine Learning Development Environment

There are few options

- Option 1: Cloud platforms
- Option 2: Native setup of your machine
- Option 3: Running a docker container
- Finally, get some data.  See our [data page](../data.md)

## Option 1: Cloud Platforms

There are popular hosted ML environments.  
This is the quickest way to get going with Python and machine learning.

Supported operating systems : All

### 1A: Google Colab

We recommend [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/).

Pros:

- Nothing to setup on your laptop
- Just need a Google account
- Supports majority of ML libraries
- Provides CPU / GPU / TPU runtime environments
- And important of all It is FREE

Cons:

- Works great with single notebooks, but including other python modules can be tricky

---

## Option 2: Native Machine Setup

Here we are going to install and setup the computer.

Supported operating systems : Windows, Mac, Linux

### Step 2A: Install Anaconda Python

We highly recommend installing Anaconda Python distribution.  
It has pretty much all the packages needed for ML.

Get it from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/) for your platform

### Step 2B:  Install Additional Packages

The following extra packages are recommended

- jupyterlab

Install as follows using CLI

```bash
    $   conda install jupyterlab
```

Also can be done via Anaconda console.

### Step 2C: Start Jupyter or Jupyterlab

Start as follows

```bash
    $   jupyter lab
```

In browser, go to Jupter page;  Usually at [localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888)


### Step 2D: Test the Setup

Use this notebook to see if your environment is setup

## Option 3: Docker Images

There are variety of Docker images that have fully setup ML environments.  
Follow the instructions for each Docker

- [ElephantScale training image](https://hub.docker.com/r/elephantscale/es-training)

## Checklist

At this point, you should

- have access to a Python development environment
