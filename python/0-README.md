# Python Basics

## Python + ML

- In the early days, Python was considered a 'toy language for ML'.  But Python has come a long way in the last few years as a very solid ML / DL language.
- It has a very thriving ecosystem of libraries in both ML and DL.  Lot of popular packages like Tensorflow have python APIs.
- It is a very easy language to pick up.  Most programmers (Java / C / PHP) can pick up Python very easily in a couple of days.. And can keep learning as they go along.   To me this very important as we don't want to spend too much time learning the language
- Python is  general purpose language.  If you learn Python, and you are not practicing ML, you can pretty much write any other system â€” web service, generic scripting ..etc using Python.
- Python has very easy to use UIs.  My favorite is Jupyter notebooks. They are web based, light weight and easy to use
- There are lots of FREE and open source resources to learn Python
