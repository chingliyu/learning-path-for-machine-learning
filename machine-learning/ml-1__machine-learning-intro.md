## What is Machine Learning

### Essential Reading

- [A nice intro to ML - video](https://youtu.be/HcqpanDadyQ)
- [7 types of machine learning - video](https://youtu.be/nKW8Ndu7Mjw)
- [A gentle guide to machine learning](https://monkeylearn.com/blog/gentle-guide-to-machine-learning/)
- [What ML can and can not do - a video by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/ai-for-everyone/what-machine-learning-can-and-cannot-do-rv1fW)
- [Chapter 1. What is machine learning?](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/real-world-machine-learning/9781617291920/kindle_split_011.html) of [Real World Machine Learning book](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/real-world-machine-learning/9781617291920/) offers a great intro ML and use cases

### More Reading

- I highly recommend ["AI for everyone" - video series by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-for-everyone) at Coursera
- [Machine learning for beginners](https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-for-beginners-d247a9420dab)

### Little More Theory

- [Ch 2 of Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/) gives a pretty good overview of ML, with some essential math.

## Checklist

Check your knowledge:

* Make a list of problems machine learning can and can not solve
* Come up with a chart/diagram with machine learning algorithms.  Start with this:
  - ML Algorithms
    - Regressions
      - Examples of regression algorithms
    - Another type
      - Example
    - and so on...
* Figure out what kind of machine learning we might use for the following scenarios
  - A bank wants to identify fraudulent credit card transactions
  - We want to estimate house prices for next month
  - We want group similar shopping behaviors of our customers
  - I want to identify damaged products from my assembly line
  - In self driving scenario, we want to estimate where the car in front of us is
